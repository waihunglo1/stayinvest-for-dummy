This analysis is crazy accurate. Made in 1875 by Samuel Benner it shows periods of panic, as well as periods when to make money 😳 </br>

The 150-year-old Benner Cycle has predicted almost all major crises since the mid-1920s. It accurately foresaw the Great Depression, WW2, the Dot Com bubble, and the COVID crash which we recently went through. </br>

We are currently in a period of hard times and lowering asset prices, which indicates that soon there will be a good time to buy assets.</br></br>

Fascinating 150-year-old math and logic.</br>
